Secure File Sharing

1. Set Up the Concurrent Server:
Goal: Create a central server that can handle multiple client connections simultaneously.
Implementation:
Use a programming language like Python, Java, or C++ that supports threading or asynchronous I/O.
Implement basic server-client communication using sockets.
Add threading (e.g., threading library in Python) to handle multiple peers connecting at once.
Test by connecting several clients to ensure each one can interact with the server concurrently.

2. Implement Peer Authentication:
Goal: Ensure each peer has a unique account with ID and password verification.
Implementation:
Create a basic user database (e.g., a text file, SQL database, or in-memory dictionary) to store peer credentials.
When a peer connects, prompt them for their ID and password.
Implement a simple hashing mechanism (e.g., SHA-256) for password storage to add basic security.
Test by adding and authenticating multiple peers.

3. Develop the Indexing Server and File Database:
Goal: Allow the server to store and retrieve file locations based on keywords provided by each peer.
Implementation:
After authentication, allow peers to register their files and keywords with the server.
Store file information in a database or dictionary structure that maps keywords to file locations (e.g., domain name, port number).
Implement methods for peers to update their file lists and have the server automatically update the index.
Test by adding multiple files and verifying that the server can return accurate information for different keyword searches.

4. Enable Keyword-Based File Search:
Goal: Allow peers to search for files by keyword and receive a list of available peers.
Implementation:
Create a query method where a peer sends a keyword to the server.
The server should look up the keyword in its index and return a list of <domain name, port number> pairs for peers with matching files.
Test by having peers query the server with different keywords and ensuring correct information is returned.

5. Implement Secure File Transfer Protocol Between Peers:
Goal: Set up a basic peer-to-peer file transfer process initiated by the requesting peer.
Implementation:
Design a communication protocol for peers to negotiate file transfers. Use sockets for direct communication between peers.
Test the file transfer protocol by having one peer request and download a file from another peer.
6. Add Public Key Storage and Management:

Goal: Enable peers to securely share files with each other using public keys for encryption.
Implementation:
Generate RSA/DSA key pairs for each peer and store public keys in a file or database.
Share public keys securely with the peers that need them.
Test by having peers encrypt and decrypt messages or small test files to ensure the keys work properly.

7. Implement Confidential File Transfer:

Goal: Ensure the files are encrypted during transfer to prevent unauthorized access.
Implementation:
Use symmetric encryption (e.g., AES) for file data, with the encryption key secured by RSA or DSA.
Test by having a peer encrypt a file with AES, send it to another peer, and decrypt it successfully.

8. Integrate Digital Signature Support (RSA and DSA):
Goal: Allow peers to sign files, providing a way to verify authenticity and integrity.
Implementation:
Give peers the option to sign files with RSA or DSA before sending.
The receiving peer should be able to verify the signature using the senderâ€™s public key.
Test by signing files and verifying signatures to ensure accuracy.
